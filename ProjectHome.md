Yngine is an experimental game engine project... just paying around with 3D on Desktop.

Maybe have a look on Android aimed Yngine 2: https://github.com/yin/yngine2

### Features include: ###
  * JBullet as Physics engine
  * Modular Shaders definition utilizing JSON format
    * Vertex and Fragment shaders supported
  * Unique Scene Graph model.
  * 2D Texture loading
  * Model builders
    * Interpolated sphere
    * Box

### Work in progress: ###
  * Flexible particle system (This is still a target of many improvements)

### TODO: ###
  * Model loaders
  * On-line refreshing of shaders and other text-file based inputs
  * Support more shader types (e.g.: Geometry shaders)
  * Scripting engine (Object-oriented, domain-specific)
    * Consider Groovy as an Developer-level language
    * UnrealScript states can be useful
    * Haskell-like and Go-like lighweigth OO model
    * JavaScript prototype paradigm can be handy
    * Haskell functional features, Haskell runs on JVM AFAIK
  * User input and User interface
    * Mouse camera
    * Mouse picking
    * Keyboard input
    * HUD
