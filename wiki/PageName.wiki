#summary Graphical architectural art painting inspired by my real thoughts about it.

= Introduction =

Yngine is in stage of a coding playground. This diagram should approximatively describe how I see the development of Yngine now and in near future. 


All block should be self-describing, the round ones are missing in code and that's the areas where I have to get most work done. All rectangles can be found in code, the ones with one round corner need a lot of improvements.
