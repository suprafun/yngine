# Introduction #

Yngine is in stage of a coding playground. This diagram should approximatively describe how I see the development of Yngine now and in near future.


All block should be self-describing, the round ones are missing in code and that's the areas where I have to get most work done. All rectangles can be found in code, the ones with one round corner need a lot of improvements.

| **Full black arrow** | Uses directly |
|:---------------------|:--------------|
| **Hollow white arrow** | Creates, works with, or manages |
| **Full black diamond** | Contains, or physically consists of, incubates parts of  |
| **Hollow white diamond** | Uses, requests data from, invokes, listens to |
| **Sharp arrows**     | (Will...) Share states, send messages, communicate, cooperate |
| Dashed connection    | High interconnection, Code-bases can be depended on each other! |
| Dashed Border        | Logical group of interfaces, code with similar uses |

_@GoogleDocuementsTeam We all love automatically curved arrow tool... dynamically adjustable too! (... whatever it means)_
